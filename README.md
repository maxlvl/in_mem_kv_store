# KVS

A simple in-memory key-value store CLI.

Just a small toy project to get familiar with the `Clap` crate, as well as basic Rust syntax.

## Usage

`cargo build` to compile and build the project, navigate to `/target/debug/`, then run the CLI with one of the following commands:

`kvs --version`

`kvs set <key> <value>`

`kvs get <key>`

`kvs rm <key>`
